**Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?**
This is capstone from Google Data Analytics certification available on coursera.org.
In this case study I perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst in fictional company - Cyclistic.
Scenario is:
"You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations".

In this repository is folder with raw data (fictional company, license: https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) and Rmd file with report. 
I used RStudio 2022.07.2 Build 576, R version 4.2.0.
Enjoy!
